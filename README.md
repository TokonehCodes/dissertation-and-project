# dissertation-and-project

A pathfinding project that allows the enemy AI replan their movement in real time.

To view the project, simply download the .zip file and open it in Unity - it should have all the settings available and various test scenes to choose from.

All code is saved in "Scripts" folder inside "Assets" folder but I have also added the 3 scripts to this repository.

The pdf file contains the research, planning and evaluation of the project in the form of a dissertation.


Adjacency script is the main code base with the pathfinding and replanning.
AI script shows the AI agent how to move along the map.
Path script defines the "Path" class.
